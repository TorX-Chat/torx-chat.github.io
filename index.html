		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>TorX is a C library enabling user interface developers to interface with Tor to create and manage hidden services for the purpose of transferring data peer to peer, primarily in the form of text, files, and data streams.</p>
		<h2>Key Points:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>No centralized servers, entirely peer-to-peer: The TorX project operates NO servers and clients should make NO connections outside the Tor network.</li>
			<li>Relies entirely on Tor's v3 .onion services, with v3 authentication.</li>
			<li>Full-Duplex connection utilization (more reliable, faster transfers).</li>
			<li>No PINGs, no ACKs (by default). Near instantaneous message delivery. Minimized network traffic.</li>
			<li>Unlimited message sizes; fast & resumable file transfers with b3sum hash verification. Support for data streams.</li>
			<li>Utilizes SQLCipher for storage of messages, keys, settings, Torrc</li>
			<li>Secure memory allocation and sanitization (in the library)</li>
			<li>Allows client developers to use the base protocols and/or implement their own text/binary/stream protocols, after handshake</li>
			<li>Focus on reducing line counts, avoiding code duplication, providing realistic auditability. Library ~10,000 lines of C, UI clients ~8000 lines.</li>
			<li>Limited scope: UI developers can implement the kitchen sink, but the library will forever remain lean.</li>
			<li>Guiding Philosophy: KISS + not letting users do stupid things</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Distinguishing Points from all other Tor chats:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Initial handshakes use single-use onion services (called TorX-IDs), which are unique and destroyed after the first handshake. This allows TorX-IDs (or OnionIDs, if you prefer), to be transferred over mediums which can be monitored (such as Twitter DMs, Facebook messager, WhatsApp, etc, without allowing the adversary access to permanent metadata (an "identity"))</li>
			<li>No usernames, no avatars, no shared identities. You are a different person to everyone you connect to, except in groups. No metadata is shared except the times at which you connect and disconnect, which are only available to those who are connected to you.</li>
			<li>TorX-IDs can be shorter than onion service names ("OnionIDs", 56 characters), at <= 52 characters (48 by default), due to stripping of the version byte, the truncated checksum, and implementation of a multi-threaded onion generator to generate a *Q base32 suffix.</li>
			<li>Group Chats (both invite-only and public) operate entirely peer-to-peer</li>
			<li>Kill Codes -- if you believe you are are compromised, you can inform other peers and request that they delete associated keys/messages.</li>
			<li>Protocol independence: The library doesn't care whether you transfer text/binary/stream, and supports custom protocols.</li>
			<li>Pure C library allowing easy integration into any UI language.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>History:</h2>
		<p>The developer was tired of having to manage dozens of anonymous email, XMPP accounts, and associated keys, on top of having to maintain anonymity. We all are.</p>
		<p>The developer's friend's family member ended up on Interpol's "Red List" and the developer watched their friend struggle to maintain constant communication with their family member, sometimes going for weeks without communication, as their family member travelled the world using a combination of illicitly obtained passports and unlawful border crossings. When they were in contact, one day they would use a Korean instant messenger, the next day one from Pakistan, and on. It was tedious and unreliable.</p>
		<p>The developer was inspired to solve this problem not just for the technically competent (like the developer), but also for the technically illiterate (like the developer's friend and their family member).</p>
		<h2>Threat Model</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> affiliated advanced nation state(s) with near unlimited access and resources, including the ability to compromise or drone strike users' endpoint devices, if identified.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Primary Goals:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Prevent any advanced nation state from being able to know who any user is communicating with, to prevent targetted supply-chain attacks and endpoint compromise</li>
			<li>Allow users to manage unlimited identities in a single client and minimize (as much as technologically possible) the ability to correlate the accounts.</li>
			<li>Allow you to securely and safely chat with your grandma and <a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices/View-Red-Notices/">someone on the Interpol Red List</a> at the same time, using the same client.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Safety</h1>
		<p>As of intial pre-release (June 2024), this is absolute bleeding-edge alpha software. It's absolutely not ready to be used with untrusted peers at this time. This is the primary reason it is open source but not FOSS *yet*.</p>
		<h3>DO:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#contribute">Contribute</a> or <a href="#donate">donate</a>.</li>
			<li>Download your binaries or source code over Tor. Alternatively, download signatures over Tor.</li>
			<li>Use single-use IDs, not multi-use, when possible.</li>
			<li>Prefer invite-only groups over public groups (invitor is tracked)</li>
			<li>Prefer direct messaging over group chats</li>
			<li>Understand the primary limitation: Connection/disconnection times can allow peers connected to you in groups and otherwise to make highly accurate correlations between your various identities</li>
			<li>Only communicate with trusted peers (for now)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>DO NOT:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Package it for public repositories (Debian, Arch, FDroid, Google Play, Microsoft Store, etc). It is not ready.</li>
			<li>Connect to potential adversaries / malicious peers. It is not ready.</li>
			<li>Use groups or multi-use IDs without understanding the implications: Connection/disconnection times can allow peers connected to you in groups and otherwise to make highly accurate correlations between your various identities</li>
			<li>Fail to strip metadata from files. Stripping metadata from file transfers is beyond the scope of the library and currently not implemented by either UI client.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Two proof-of-concept TorX UI clients are currently available for Android and Linux. It will soon be available for Windows and Mac. Later we intend for it to be available on iOS.</p>

		<h1>Contact / Support</h1>
		<p>At the present time, due to the alpha status of the software, the preferred method of obtaining support is on IRC. The following channels exist, in order of preference:</p>

		<p>The lead developer's IRC nick is "TorX" and their client supports OTR (Off The Record) encryption. Please do not do anything in the channels that violates the respective network's Terms of Service. If you need help connecting to IRC, ask ChatGPT.</p>
